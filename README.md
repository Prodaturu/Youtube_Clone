# YouTube Front-end Clone

## Overview

This project is a simplified clone of YouTube, the popular video-sharing platform. It is designed to replicate the look and feel of YouTube's main interface, including the header, sidebar, and video grid. While it doesn't include all the functionalities of the real YouTube, it serves as a great starting point for understanding how to structure a large-scale web application.

## Features

- **Header Section**: Contains the YouTube logo, search bar, voice search, and user-related icons such as upload, notifications, and user profile.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Includes links to various sections like Home, Explore, Subscriptions, Originals, YouTube Music, and Library.
- **Video Grid**: Displays a collection of video previews with thumbnails, video titles, authors, and view statistics.
